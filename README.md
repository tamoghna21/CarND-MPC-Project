# Model Predictive Control for Autonomous Driving

## Model Predictive control transforms a Tracking problem into a Optimal Control Problem. First we have a model of the system with the state vector and the control inputs. We define a cost function based on the current and future model predicted state vector. The Optimal Control problem is to find the Control inputs such that the cost is minimized
