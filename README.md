# Model Predictive Control for Autonomous Driving

Model Predictive control transforms a tracking problem into a Optimal Control Problem. First we have a model of the system with the state vector and the control inputs. We define a cost function based on the current and future model predicted state vector. The optimal Control problem is to find the Control inputs such that the cost is minimized.

#### Note: This Project is part of the Udacity Self Driving Car nanodegree program.
